# homelab

## Hi there! this is Vlad

...and I am a software developer that has a hobby of DIY / self-hosting / trying new things.
This repo came up out of curiosity and taught me things that helped me on my job as well. 
Last, but not least, it gave me the satisfaction of doing it yourself and working ^^

## What is is?

This is a small homelab that suits a very small home and a space where to learn new things.

It started with hosting Home Assistant in docker, went with the flow and now there are several services for - infra/monitoring/media/utils.

## what I learn doing it?

- docker compose
- docker swarm
- github actions
- logs/metrics scraping and visualization
- service integration
- using a reverse proxy - load balancing
- self-hosting

## what's next?

Not sure as the TODO: list becomes bigger each time I implement/test something, as trying to accomplish that I stumble upon many other interesting apps
