# Homelab Overview

Hi there! this is Vlad — and I am a software developer that has a hobby of DIY / self-hosting / trying new things.
This repo came out of curiosity and taught me things that helped me on my job as well. It started with hosting Home Assistant
in Docker and grew into several services for infra/monitoring/media/utils.

## What I’ve learned
- Self-hosting
- Docker Compose
- Docker Swarm
- GitHub Actions
- Logs/metrics scraping and visualization
- Service integration
- Reverse proxy & load balancing

## Quick links
- [Services](services/_index.md)
- [Changelog](changelog.md)
